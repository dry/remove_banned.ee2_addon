This is a proof of concept addon to remove banned members from the
View Members page unless requested with the group filter.

This demonstrates overloading a standard model in order to modify
the member query.

*NOTE: this will not work on versions earlier than 2.4.0*

Install the extension as per the EE docs. There is no configuration.

This has been tested on a relatively stock install of EE 2.4.0 without
a significant number of other addons. Please exercise caution when
testing this and make sure to backup your data.
